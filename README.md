# RSOL - Liquid Staking Learning Platform

A comprehensive **educational and demonstration platform** for understanding Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) on Solana. This platform allows users to learn, visualize, and interact with yield-based staking and unstaking mechanics through hands-on demos.

## üéØ What is This Platform?

This is a **learning-focused DeFi application** designed to help users understand LST protocols by:

1. **Interactive Staking Demo** - Stake SOL with adjustable yield (0-20%) to see how RSOL is minted
2. **Interactive Unstaking Demo** - Unstake RSOL with adjustable yield to see how SOL is returned
3. **Real-time Protocol Logic** - Watch yield changes affect staking/unstaking ratios instantly
4. **Educational Content** - Comprehensive explanations of LST mechanics and protocol logic
5. **Risk-free Learning** - All demos work on Solana devnet with no real funds at risk

## üêõ Educational Troubleshooting

### Common Learning Issues

**1. "I don't understand LSTs" - Learning Support**
```bash
# Solutions:
- Start with the landing page explanations
- Play with yield sliders before reading formulas
- Watch the live calculations change
- Try small test transactions to see the process
```

**2. "Yield calculations seem backwards" - Understanding Help**
```bash
# Educational clarity:
- Higher yield = platform takes more risk
- Higher yield = less RSOL per SOL when staking
- Higher yield = more SOL per RSOL when unstaking
- Use sliders to see this relationship visually
```

**3. "Demo transactions failed" - Technical Learning**
```bash
# Educational debug steps:
1. Check wallet is on Solana devnet
2. Get free devnet SOL from faucets
3. Start with small amounts (0.1 SOL)
4. Clear browser cache if issues persist
5. Check monitor page for transaction status
```

**4. "Can't see my RSOL tokens" - Learning Support**
```bash
# Educational troubleshooting:
1. Check if staking transaction completed on /monitor
2. Verify you're looking at devnet, not mainnet
3. Refresh wallet or check rsol-balance API
4. Remember: this is educational devnet, not real tokens
```

### Learning Commands

```bash
# Check you're on educational devnet
solana config get

# Check educational wallet balance  
solana balance YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS --url devnet

# Get free educational devnet SOL
solana airdrop 1 YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS --url devnet
```
